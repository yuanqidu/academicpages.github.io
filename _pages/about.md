Yuanqi Du received Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. He is now a researcher at a start-up company, DP Technology, working on molecule simulation. He holds a visiting position at University of Amsterdam with Prof. Max Welling. During the past, he is fortunate to work closely with Prof. Adji Bousso Dieng at Princeton, Prof. Bolei Zhou at CUHK (now at UCLA), Prof. S. Kevin Zhou at CAS, Prof. Hu Han at CAS, Prof. Liang Zhao at Emory University, Prof. Amarda Shehu at George Mason University. He has published several papers in top Machine Learning conferences including NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, AAAI, etc. He is very fasinated by Sciences and very intrerested in developing ML tools for scentific problems, especially new knowledge discovery. He is actively collaborateing with researchers in chemistry, biology, physics, machine learning and data mining.
<!-- He has broad interests in machine learning and data mining. Previously, he worked on Outlier Detection, American Sign Language Recognition (Milimeter Wave Signals & Kinect), Medical Image Analysis, Protein Structure Prediction, Molecule Generation, Deep Generative Model, and Deep Graph Learning. He worked with [Dr. Liang Zhao](http://cs.emory.edu/~lzhao41/), [Dr. Amarda Shehu](https://cs.gmu.edu/~ashehu/), [Dr. Parth Pathak](http://www.phpathak.com/), [Dr. Carlotta Domeniconi](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=aKkIMogAAAAJ&hl=en) while he was at GMU. He worked with [Dr. Hu Han](https://sites.google.com/site/huhanhomepage/) and [Dr. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) on Medical Image Analysis in the MIRACLE Lab at Chinese Academy of Sciences. He worked with Dr. Jianwei Zhu on Protein Structure Prediction at Microsoft Research Asia Machine Learning and Computational Biology group. He holds visiting positions at UvA AMLAB with [Dr. Max Welling](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/), CUHK MMLab with [Dr. Bolei Zhou](http://bzhou.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), and [Dr. Adji Bousso Dieng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diengadji45/en) at Princeton University. He is now a researcher under supervision of [Dr. Linfeng Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jk7qwmcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) at [DP Technology](https://www.dp.tech/). He has published several papers in top Machine Learning conferences, such as NeurIPS, ICLR, KDD, AAAI, etc. Besides Machine Learning, he is very fasinated by Sciences and very intrerested in developing ML tools for scentific problems, especially new knowledge discovery. He is actively collaborateing with researchers in chemistry, biology, physics, machine learning and data mining. -->
