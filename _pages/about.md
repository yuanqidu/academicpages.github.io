Yuanqi Du is a CS PhD student at Cornell University. During the past, he spent time at DP Technology, a start-up company working on molecule simulation, AMLab at University of Amsterdam with Prof. Max Welling, MMLab at CUHK with Prof. Bolei Zhou, Emory University with Prof. Liang Zhao and George Mason University with Prof. Amarda Shehu. He is a passionate community builder, which he founded the series of [*AI for Science workshops*](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/), co-founded a new [*Learning on Graphs conference*](https://logconference.github.io/), led an initiative *AI for Science 101* for knowledge-sharing in AI for Science. He received Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. He has published papers in Machine Learning conferences (e.g. NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD, AAAI). He is very fascinated by Sciences and interested in developing ML tools for scientific problems, especially for new knowledge discovery. He is actively collaborateing with researchers in chemistry, biology, physics, and machine learning.

**I am open to discussions about interesting ideas, drop me an email if you'd like to talk/collaborate about any of the following research topics with me. If you are an undergraduate or master student who would like to work with me, we also have projects that are actively looking for additional collaborators.**

**Research Interests**
  * Geometric Deep Learning
  * Deep Generative Model
  * AI for Science (Biology/Chemistry/Physics/etc)
  * Machine Learning for Discovery

* 6/22 We are launching a new initiative *AI for Science 101* that aims to encourage knowledge-sharing and collection in AI for Science, find out [what we are doing and why we are doing](https://t.co/VAL6kuSqyY) and [read more](https://ai4science101.deepmodeling.com/en/latest/index.html)!  
* 5/22 Our paper Equivariant Graph Neural Networks with Complete Local Frames has been accepted in ICML 2022! 
* 3/22 We have released a comprehensive survey on molecule design, [*MolGenSurvey: A Systematic Survey in Machine Learning Models for Molecule Design*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.14500.pdf), welcome any comments or feedback!
* 3/22 The sceond [*AI for Science* workshop](http://www.ai4science.net/icml22/) will be hosted together with ICML 2022 (hybrid), stay tuned for more information!
* 3/22 We have recenlty been working on a new initiative, [*Learning on Graphs conference*](https://logconference.github.io/) along with a stellar list of advisory board members where we aim to advance graph machine learning as a community and emphasize on the review quality! Any thoughts are welcome!
* 12/21 Excited to announce that we (myself, Prof. Adji Bousso Dieng, Prof. Yoon Kim, Dr. Rianne van den berg, Prof. Yoshua Bengio) are hosting the second [*Deep Generative Models for Highly Structured Data workshop*](https://deep-gen-struct.github.io/) with ICLR 2022, welcome to join us (submission deadline has been extended to March 7)!
* 10/21 [*GraphGT*](https://graphgt.github.io/), the first [*Machine Learning Datasets for Graph Generation and Transformation*](https://graphgt.github.io/), has been accepted in *NeurIPS 2021*. Welcome feedback and dataset contribution!
* 7/21 I am proud to announce that the first [*AI for Science* workshop](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/) will be held with NeurIPS 2021. We focus on the gaps that stifle advacenment of AI for Science this year. We invite a list of poineers in AI for Science for great talks and panels. We also introduce very exciting Attention Track, Mentorship, and Award programs. Welcome to submit your work and join us in December! Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AI_for_Science).
