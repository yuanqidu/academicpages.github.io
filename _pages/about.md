Yuanqi Du is a CS PhD student at Cornell University, working on Artificial Intelligence with Prof. Carla P. Gomes. During the past, he spent time at AMLab at University of Amsterdam advised by Prof. Max Welling and DP Technology supervised by Dr. Linfeng Zhang. He is a passionate community builder, which he founded the series of [*AI for Science workshops*](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/), co-founded a new [*Learning on Graphs conference*](https://logconference.github.io/), led an initiative [*AI for Science 101*](https://ai4science101.github.io/) building knowledge systems for AI for Science. He received Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. He is very fascinated by Sciences and interested in developing ML tools for scientific problems, especially for new knowledge discovery. He is actively collaborating with researchers in chemistry, biology, physics, and machine learning. He maintains a slack channel for AI for Science, feel free to join and say Hi to people [here](https://join.slack.com/t/aiforscience/shared_invite/zt-1bdof1jmf-YtIjkUVA5DquXguEiOXGPQ)!
