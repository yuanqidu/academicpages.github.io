Yuanqi Du is a CS PhD student at Cornell University, working on Computational Sustainability with Prof. Carla Gomes. During the past, he spent time at AMLab at University of Amsterdam advised by Prof. Max Welling and DP Technology supervised by Dr. Linfeng Zhang. He is a passionate community builder, which he founded the series of [*AI for Science workshops*](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/), co-founded a new [*Learning on Graphs conference*](https://logconference.github.io/), led an initiative [*AI for Science 101*](https://ai4science101.github.io/) building knowledge systems for AI for Science. He received Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from George Mason University in 2021. He is very fascinated by Sciences and interested in developing ML tools for scientific problems, especially for new knowledge discovery. He is actively collaborating with researchers in chemistry, biology, physics, and machine learning. He maintains a slack channel for AI for Science, feel free to join and say Hi to people [here](https://join.slack.com/t/aiforscience/shared_invite/zt-1bdof1jmf-YtIjkUVA5DquXguEiOXGPQ)!

* 4/23 Following the recent progress of probabilistic inference and generative modeling at Hawaii this summer [@SPIGM ICML 2023](https://spigmworkshop.github.io/)!
* 7/22 [AI for Science: Progress and Promises](https://ai4sciencecommunity.github.io/) will be held again **in-person** with NeurIPS 2022! Looking forward to your excellent submissions! 
* 6/22 We are launching a new initiative *AI for Science 101* that aims to encourage knowledge-sharing and collection in AI for Science, find out [what we are doing and why we are doing](https://t.co/VAL6kuSqyY) and [read more](https://ai4science101.deepmodeling.com/en/latest/index.html)!  
* 3/22 The sceond [*AI for Science* workshop](http://www.ai4science.net/icml22/) will be hosted together with ICML 2022 (hybrid), stay tuned for more information!
* 3/22 We have recenlty been working on a new initiative, [*Learning on Graphs conference*](https://logconference.github.io/) along with a stellar list of advisory board members where we aim to advance graph machine learning as a community and emphasize on the review quality! Any thoughts are welcome!
